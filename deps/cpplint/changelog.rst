1.5.2 (2020-06-24)

1.5.1 (2020-06-05)
-----

* Revert #43 behavior change for include order from 1.5.0, and hide it behind command-line-flag `--includeorder=standardcfirst`.
  It turns out there is no easy objective way to tell c system headers from certain c++ library headers, and Google cpplint intentionally classifies some C++ header includes as C system header for simplicity.
* Libraries considered as C system headers using --includeorder=standardcfirst now also includes linux-specifc headers (glibc-devel, glibc-kernheaders, linux-libc-dev).


1.5.0 (2020-05-31)
-----

* Fix #43 false positives in header include order by checking includes against a list of c headers.
  Since this interprets certain include lines different than before, output about header include order changes.

1.4.6 (2020-05-31)
-----

* Escape backslashes in pydoc strings to get rid of DeprecationWarning.
* Fix false positive "should include its header" for 3rd party headers
* Add support for c++17 tuple destructuring
* fix #123: Inconsistent behavior of --headers and --extensions
